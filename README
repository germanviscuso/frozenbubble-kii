The Android port of the Frozen Bubble game.  Developed with SDK v. 1.1_r1.
The code is based on the Java version of Frozen Bubble created by Glenn
Sanson.  The original Frozen Bubble was created by Guillaume Cottenceau
(programming), Alexis Younes and Amaury Amblard-Ladurantie (artwork) and
Matthias Le Bidan (soundtrack).

The Android port, just like the original Frozen Bubble, is covered by
GNU GPL v2.
